**Nomi** is a benchmarking tool that tests a [fleet](https://github.com/coreos/fleet) cluster. With Nomi, you can deploy benchmark units that employ [Docker](https://github.com/docker/docker), [rkt](https://github.com/coreos/rkt) containers, or just raw `systemd` units. Nomi is able to collect some metrics and generate some plots from those. To make use of Nomi, you just need to define your own benchmark using a YAML file. Nomi parses this file and runs the benchmark according to the instructions defined in it. Additionally, Nomi provides the possibility to define instructions in one line using the parameter `raw-instructions`.

## Requirements

Nomi requires to be installed on a fleet cluster-node to run properly.

Dependencies:

- fleet and systemd running on the host machine.
- In case you want to run Docker or rkt containers, the respective tool needs to be running on the host machines, too.
- Optional: To generate gnu plots, support for gnuplot is required on the host machine. Alternatively, you can run Nomi as a Docker container, which comes with gnuplot installed, as shown below.
